		<p> WE'RE overjoyed to see H&M has just launched a beauty range. The 700 products- spanning make-up, haircare, body care and beauty styling - are inspired by seasonal trneds and colours, and come in sleek black and gold packaging. The pigments in all the products are strong and long-lasting, too. <strong >From only 19.99</strong></p>
