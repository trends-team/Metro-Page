		About Me

			<p>
			Hey! Im Will, im 19, I was a first year Uni student, but decided not to go onto year two as I felt the course was too slow and unimpressive course content.<br> I am currently on and front end training course.
			<br>When im not coding i enjoy:
			<ul>
					<li>Tennis</li>
					<li>Badminton</li>
					<li>Swimming</li>
					<li>Skiing</li>		
			</ul>
			other thing that i occationaly get up to include; rock climbing, chess, video games and I am taking part in The 2016 Bloodwise Blenheim Palace Triathlon

			<p>
			I enroled on this course because I thought it would be an excelent why to get the knowlage required to become a web developer.
			Thus far in the iron yard front end<br> course we have covered and become familiar with the workings of html and css, starting from the ground up by first looking at the semantic meaning of commonly used tags<br> (to try and get us into good habits early), and swifty covering document layout and then moving onto implimentation of css. <br>I have applied these new found skills in both indipendatly and in a team environment by creating both a 'shard landing page' and a page from the metro paper (in responsive format).<br>
			In addition to the above I have also constucted webpages using boostrap, flexbox, and indipendant reactive design.<br>
			By the end of the course I should have a comprehensive grounding in html css and javascript, with an end of bootcamp project to showcase what i have absorbed.	
			</p>

		Whats Next

			<p>
			Of course at the end of this bootcamp I want to put my new found skills to use, and one thing that I have found so far in the process to be very motivating is the rate at which <br>I am learning something which I previously found dounting. I would like to continue on this trajectory and so an environment where I can continue to grow my knowlage<br> (be it though solo effort or with help from co-workers) would be very benifitial to me.
